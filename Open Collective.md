CoSocial uses Open Collective to accept membership payments, donations, and to show a transparent expense and budget process.

The page for CoSocial is at [opencollective.com/cosocial](https://opencollective.com/cosocial)

You'll need to either setup an account and basic profile on Open Collective, or pay anonymously, and we can verify your email address and payment details in the confirmation.

$50CAD per year is the current contribution for a member account. You'll be prompted to optionally contribute to the Open Collective platform itself.

You may choose to contribute at the higher tiers of Maintainer or Organization level, or make a donation. You'll be acknowledged and thanked as being a contributor at those tiers in various places on the blog and other public spaces.

If you have paid for something and need to be re-imbursed, this will be listed in the [expenses section](https://opencollective.com/cosocial/expenses).
