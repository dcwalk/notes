The [[Trust & Safety Team]] handles new signups. The process was recently described in the [It's Happening blog post](https://cosocial.info/its-happening/).

We are asking potential new members to [sign up](https://cosocial.ca/auth/sign_up) on the CoSocial Mastodon instance.

That first prompts potential new members to accept the [[Server Rules]]. After clicking on accept, you'll see the standard Mastodon sign up form:

The "Why do you want to join?" is required. You can help let us know what about the CoSocial Co-Op is interesting or important to you.

The Trust & Safety team will be notified, and send you an email asking you to pay for your membership by going to the [[Open Collective]]. Basic co-op membership is $50CAD per year, and includes your membership fee in the co-op.

When payment is completed, we'll activate your Mastodon account, and you're ready to further set up your profile.

There is more [[Member Onboarding]] to be done, but having an activated Mastodon account is a great start, and you can communicate with all other members on the server itself.

Welcome to CoSocial, thanks for becoming a co-op member and helping to own your own Canadian social web service!
