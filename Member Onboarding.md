First step is the [[Sign Up Process]], and then you'll have an active Mastodon account.

It is tradition to make a new post on the server with a [[Hashtag]] of #introduction -- introduce yourself, talk about what you're interested in and likely to post about, and what other topics and people you're looking to connect with.

You may also want to include the #CoSocialCa tag to your introduction, and to any posts about the service.

The [@coop@cosocial.ca](https://cosocial.ca/@coop) account is a shared account that will post announcements and can be asked questions or help facilitate discussion about the Mastodon server and any other co-op operations.

Also check out the [[CoSocial Blog]] for longer form announcements, to which links will also be posted using the coop account.

## Github

The public Github notes repository -- where the source for this page lives -- can be reached at https://github.com/CoSocial-Canada/notes.

It also holds a public suggestions and project board that can be viewed at this link https://github.com/orgs/CoSocial-Canada/projects/1

We also have a [Github Discussions area](https://github.com/orgs/CoSocial-Canada/discussions) for long form discussion on topics related to the co-op and its services.

We are still evaluating which of these services and spaces are usable by all members. We acknowledge that Github can be intimidating and confusing for less technical members.

For now, feel free to have a look around, introduce yourself if you'd like to get more involved in [[TechOps]], and of course comment, make suggestions, and otherwise participate.

## Staff

Volunteers and core members additionally will be added to other operations spaces such as Slack and private Github repositories, which we'll document in [[Staff Onboarding]].

_Note: This page is a Work in Progress #wip. There are various suggestions around spaces for member chat, support, documentation, and more._
