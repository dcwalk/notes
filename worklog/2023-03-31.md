Server was down for around 40 minutes today. [[bmann]] did the following steps 
* powered down the droplet
* made a snapshot, which took about 24 minutes
* resized to a larger droplet (Premium Intel 8GB RAM, 8 vCPU)
* powered back on
* flipped the switch on migrating [[bmann]] account from [[Social.Coop]], just over 2000 following
* Was briefly unresponsive but then was fine
* Imported the backed up "following" list, about 1300

Setting up [[Obsidian]] to be able to edit the notes repo. Made instructions for [[Setting up Obsidian and Working Copy Git on iOS]].

Talked to [[timbray]] about likely migrating his account for Easter (next Friday)
