### Tech Co-Ops List

https://tech-coops.xyz/

> A list of tech coops and resources concerning tech coops and worker owned cooperatives in general.

> Tech cooperatives are worker-owned cooperatives that operate in the information technology industry. This list focuses on tech coops that are providing software development and consulting services.

The source for this list is on GitHub and you can [contribute](https://github.com/hng/tech-coops/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). They maybe open to re-organizing to split out the North America section so that there is a Canada section. 

It also has many other links and resources.
