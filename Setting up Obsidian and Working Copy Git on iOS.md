You can use the [[Obsidian]] mobile app on iOS with the [[Working Copy]] app in order to sync, edit, and publish the notes repo. 

## Setup Obsidian

Install the Obsidian app and create a new vault. Don't create it in iCloud. Give it a name like "CoSocialNotes".

## Setup Working Copy

Once you have installed and paid for Working Copy, follow these steps. 

Clone the CoSocial-Canada/notes repo

Click the "Repository - Status and configuration"

Click the down arrow next to the title (which by default will be called notes) and you'll get a drop-down menu

Select "Link Repository to..." and navigate to On My iPhone > Obsidian > (vault name folder) and select "open" at top right. 

Now all the files from the CoSocial repo will be in your vault.
